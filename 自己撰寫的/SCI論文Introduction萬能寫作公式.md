背景（Background）：
- 引入研究領域和問題 ⭢描述相關研究的背景和重要性，闡明當前知識的不足或存在的研究空白
- 解釋為什麽你的研究是有意義的，並指出你要解決的問題或填補的知識缺口

＄範例：
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as a rapidly growing field of research ==due to their unique properties and promising applications in various fields.== （一個東西，他被拿出來寫研究，一定有其原因）Graphene, as the pioneer of 2D materials, has attracted significant attention for its exceptional electrical, mechanical, and optical properties. ==However, the absence of a bandgap limits its application in certain electronic devices==.（指出他仍有缺陷） ==Therefore==（因此這篇寫研究的原因）, there is a need to explore other 2D materials that possess a tunable bandgap and can address this limitation.



目標（Gap）：概述研究目標和研究問題。明確你的研究目標，指出你要解決的問題或假設。確保你的目標與背景相呼應，並且具有明確的方向和焦點。
＄範例：
In this context, material ABC has recently emerged as a promising 2D material with a tunable bandgap. ABC, a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), exhibits intriguing electronic and optical properties, making it an atractive candidate for electronic and optoelectronic applications. ==However, a comprehensive understanding of ABC's properties, synthesis methods, and device integration is still in its early stages.==（前面概述，後面提到缺顯處）



方法（Approach）：簡要描述研究方法和實驗設計。
- 概述你的實驗方法和研究設計，說明你將如何回答你的研究問題或測試你的假設。
- 近一步可以提供一些關鍵的實驗步驟或技術，但不需要過於詳細。
In this study, we aim to investigate the structural, electrical, and optical properties of ABC through a series of experiments. ==We synthesized high-quality ABC flakes using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and characterized their morphology and thickness== using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The crystal structure and purity of ABC were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Electrical measurements, including field-effect transistor (FET) characterization, were conducted to evaluate the charge transport properties of ABC. Furthermore, photoluminescence spectroscopy was employed to study the optical properties and excitonic behavior of ABC.


 補充（Complement）：
