A wave of bedbug outbreaks [1] in Europe and Asia has caused panic on a global scale. Infestations[2] in cities including Paris and Seoul have pushed authorities to cracks down on the bloodsucking[3] pests in the hope of bringing them under control.

The insects, which often cluster[4] in beds and clothing, live off[5] the blood of humans and other animals. They can be difficult to detect and even harder to get rid of.[6] Worse yet, they're easily spread in the luggage of international travelers. Although they don't appear to spread any diseases, their bites can cause itchy is rashes, allergy[過敏性] symptoms[癥狀], and even psychological effects in humans.

In Paris, severe infestations have been reported since last September, and the government is eager to exterminate the bugs before the city hosts the Olympic Games in July. Meanwhile, in Seoul, where people have been avoiding cinemas and trains with fabric[布料] seats, the mayor has created a task force to deal with the a fast-spreading problem.

The most effective way to kill the bugs is with heat, as they typically die if exposed to temperatures around 50 degrees Celsius for about two hours. Heat treatments will thus so be among the various measures[措施] taken by cities and citizens alike as they struggle to destroy the unwelcome guests.
