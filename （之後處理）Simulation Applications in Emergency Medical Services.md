# Introduction
Prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) play an important role in the initial stabilization and transport of critically ill patients daily around the world. In the USA, there are an estimated 840,000 certified first responders and, of these, there are greater than 192,000 EMS providers.1 These individuals work for a variety of governmental and private organizations such as fire departments, private companies, volunteers, hospitals, and third-party providers. All states require a trained and certified EMS responder to provide emergency medical care in the event of a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) incident and the administration of antidotes as dictated by region.1 As a response to September 11, comprehensive competency-based curricula for terrorism preparedness have been created.2The hallmark of an expertly trained EMS provider is the ability to recognize rapidly and treat immediate life threats, initiate timely communication with receiving facilities to prepare them for patient arrival, and execute proper protocols in the event of a disaster or mass casualty. EMS providers require a unique skill set to deal effectively with the complexities of the scope of their practice. They are under significant time pressure to triage and initiate treatment for unstable patients. This requires clear thinking and poise. They must be able to think flexibly and cope with an array of environmental factors particular to the scene. Additionally, they need to be able to work effectively while maintaining situational awareness of dangers to their personal safety. Finally, they need to maintain vigilance and be prepared to react to the possibility that their scene response is potentially related to a mass casualty or disaster that they have neverexperienced. Simulation-based training assists EMS systems and providers prepare for these contingencies.

>院前緊急醫療服務（EMS）在全球每天起著重要作用，對危重病人進行初步穩定和運送。在美國，估計有840,000名經認證的急救人員，其中超過192,000名為EMS提供者。這些人工作於各種政府和私營機構，如消防部門、私營公司、志願者、醫院和第三方提供者。所有州都要求訓練有素且經認證的EMS響應者在大規模破壞性武器事件和根據地區要求的抗毒劑管理方面提供急救醫療服務。作為對9/11事件的回應，已經建立了針對恐怖主義準備的全面基於能力的課程。

# 文獻探討
## EMS Training
Simulation-based training for EMS professionals has broad applica- tions. Procedural skills required include cardiopulmonary resuscitation, basic and advanced airway skills, intravenous and intraosseous access techniques, electrocardiogram and telemetry interpretation, and adminis- tration of pharmacologic agents. Broader skills include proficiency with standard operating procedures and regional protocols, as well as effective teamwork behaviors. 

With the use of airway task trainers, procedures that can be taught include airway assessment, oxygen administration, oral and nasal airway application, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, endotracheal intu- bation, laryngeal mask airways and other airway bridge devices, and surgical airways. Cardiopulmonary skills amenable to task training include effective bag-valve-mask ventilation, performance of chest com- pressions, and intravenous/intraosseous access.

Simulation-based investigation on airway management with prehospital providers has been an area of significant research. Simulation has been used to investigate which difficult airway abnormalities affect success rate of orotracheal intubation in novice intubators.3 The King LT Supralaryngeal Airway device (Noblesville, IN) may be advantageous in prehospital airway management situations involving multiple patients or hazardous environments and was shown to be performed faster than endotracheal intubation when performed by community EMS providers.4 Simulation has been used to demonstrate that a paramedic’s success in securing a difficult airway may depend on the type of airway device they use.5 Additionally, in a 2011 usability study of 7 different types of supraglottic airway devices in 41 previously inexperienced paramedics following training on a manikin model, the investigators found that endotracheal intubation success rates by paramedics 3 months after simulation training was significantly less than 5 different supraglottic airway devices (Laryngeal mask unique [LMA] [LMA Company North America, San Diego, CA], Laryngeal tube disposable [King-LT-D, VBM, Sulz, Germany], I-Gel [Intersurgical Ltd, Wokingham, England], Com- bitube [Covidien, Mansfield, MA], and EasyTube [Teleflexmedical Ruesch, Research Triangle Park, NC]), indicating that simulation may have a role in identifying methods that are more preferable for newer paramedics in the prehospital setting.6 A just-in-time educational inter- vention was able to demonstrate retention of skill with LMA placement at 6 months. Fifty-five first-year paramedic students watched a manufactur- er’s LMA instruction video and practiced insertion in 3 different task trainers. Six months later, subjects were randomized to an intervention (reviewing the video and 10 minutes unsupervised practice) or control group before participating in a high-fidelity simulated clinical scenario. Those in the intervention group displayed significantly shorter insertion times (P  0.029), displayed fewer attempts to achieve success (P  0.033), and had significantly higher LMA skill performance levels (P  0.019) at 6 months

## Disaster Preparedness 災難防備

First responders need to be able to identify a mass casualty situation, recognize the potential causes based on the presentation, and trigger alerts to initiate containment protocols. Because bioterrorist events will likely occur without warning and the cause will not be known, symptom-based, all-hazards, decision-making algorithmic approaches have been proposed to improve providers’ ability to predict the cause and initiate rapid treatment. Bond et al. studied the use of this type of algorithm on the ability of health care providers to correctly choose the proper triage and management for 26 unknown terrorism scenarios.13 Each required that one make a triage choice on the “attack” algorithm (the trunk algorithm) and then proceed to 1 of 4 other branch algorithms (dirty resuscitation, chemical agents, biological agents, bomb/blast/radiation dispersal device) to make a final triage choice. The authors found that the 110 physicians and nurses who participated in the study performed substantially better than would have been expected by chance alone. The overall total score was 45% correct for all participants, whereas the conditional probability of guessing both the attack algorithm and the final card correct ranged from 4.7% for the biological, chemical, and bomb/blast algorithms to 2.4% for the dirty resuscitation algorithm.13 The algorithms described by Bond et al. have been implemented in an Advanced Bioterrorism Training Course at our NorthShore Center for Simulation and Innovation Highland Park Hospital Simulation Campus in Highland Park, IL to extensively disseminate this training to EMS providers throughout Lake County, IL (Fig 3). Using the Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) triage system, triage accuracy in one large urban study was documented at 78%.14 During a disaster drill (train collision with blast injury and chemical release), the accuracy and speed of triage of 130 patient-actors by the Fire Department of New York City EMS personnel was evaluated using the START triage system. All EMS personnel had been previously trained in START, but refresher training was not administered before the drill. Overall triage accuracy was 78%. In patients who had additional changes in their status during the triage process (injects), 62% were retriaged appropriately.14 Triage/treatment began 40 minutes after the drill began; the average time from start of triage to transport was 1 hour and 2 minutes, and the scene was completely cleared in 2 hours and 38 minutes.14 Likewise, natural disasters pose similar potential for injury and death while exposing first responders to environmental hazards as well. In the Asia-Pacific region, where over one-half of the world’s natural disasters occur, manikin-based simulations have been effectively conducted in multiple countries to treat traumatic injuries and life threats: (1) leg wound (hemorrhagic shock/immediate); (2) chest wound (tension pneu- mothorax/immediate); (3) head wound (traumatic brain injury/expectant); and (4) limb trauma (leg fracture/delayed).15

> 許多事件都是在無預警的情況下發生，Bond等人研究了這種算法對醫療保健提供者在26個未知主義情景中正確選擇適當的分類和管理的能力 [1]。每個情請首先會對主幹算法「襲擊（attack）」進行分類選擇，然後轉到4個其他分支算法（骯髒復甦（dirty resuscitation）、化學物質（chemical agents）、生物製劑（biological agents）、炸彈/爆炸/輻射散發裝置（bomb/blast/radiation dispersal device））之一，以進行最終的分類選擇。研究指出：參與研究的110名醫生和護士的表現明顯優於僅僅按照機會預期的水平。所有參與者的整體總得分為45％正確。

Disaster drills differ from manikin-based simulations because these scenarios test the systems’ response to disaster and have broader scope and costs associated with mobilizing simulated patients, money, re- sources, time, and number of personnel it takes to correctly coordinate a proper disaster drill.12 Because of this, they are only performed period- ically and do not often address the “what if” variables associated with the uncertainties of a particular scenario. Examples of “what if” variables were described by Christie and Levary and include the following: How much time would it take, given the number of ambulances in the city, to transport the injured to hospital? How long must the injured wait for ambulances to arrive? What is the longest waiting time for a patient? How many ambulances are needed to transport the injured? If two patients are transported in an ambulance instead of one patient, how much does it reduce the transportation time? What strategy should be followed to transport the injured, first to nearby hospitals and later to hospitals that are further away? What would the change in average waiting time be for the injured or what would the total time be for transporting all patients to hospitals if variables such as arrival rate, weather, type of disaster, availability of beds, availability of trauma centers, and ambulances were changed?12

> 災難演練會基於模型的模擬不同及更廣泛的範圍和成本，包括動員模擬患者、資金、資源、時間和協調正確的災難演練所需的人員數量。Christie和Levary[1]描述了「如果（what if）」變量的示例，其中包括：在城市中有多少救護車，需要多少時間將受傷者送往醫院？受傷者等待救護車到達需要多長時間？患者的最長等待時間是多久？需要多少救護車來運送受傷者？如果一輛救護車運送兩名患者而不是一名患者，將會減少多少運輸時間？應該遵循什麼策略將受傷者首先送往附近的醫院，然後再送往更遠的醫院？
> 如果更改變量，例如到達率、天氣、災害類型、床位的可用性、創傷中心的可用性和救護車，那麼受傷者的平均等待時間將發生什麼變化，或者將所有患者送往醫院的總時間是多少？

Disaster simulations can expose system weaknesses and identify targets for improvement. A study performed to assess EMS systems’ effectiveness in response to possible chemical, biological, radiologi- cal, nuclear, explosive (CBRNE) units examined the “after-action” reports from the Office of Domestic Preparedness, Chemical Weapons Improved Response.1 They discovered that only 6 of 70 after-action reports reported the use of level C or higher personal protective equipment (PPE). Forty-four (63%) reported no additional PPE other than their regular work uniform. Twenty (28.6%) of the 70 after-action reports made no comment regarding the use of the PPE gear used by EMS providers at all.1

Hospital preparedness has been assessed with simulated exercises and training has been shown to improve topical knowledge.18 These types of exercises usually involve alerting the hospital with a hypothetical sce- nario and delivering moulaged patients of varying degrees of severity to the emergency department (ED). Each patient undergoes real-time triage and registration followed by compressed time treatment and disposition.

Patient disposition and management is beyond the ED and is often conducted as a tabletop exercise.18

Subbarao et al. report the use of a combination of high-fidelity manikin simulations and video clinical vignettes to create a curriculum to train first responders and receivers (attending emergency physicians, emergency medicine residents, nurses, physician assistants, medical students, para- medics, and ED technicians) in the acute management of victims of an unknown CBRNE event. Statistically significant improvement was noted in all learner groups post training.19
